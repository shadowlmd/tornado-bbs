{ Version 1.2 - Adds TNulStream and TXMSStream, from suggestion and
                code by Stefan Boether; TBitFilter, from suggestion
                by Rene Seguin; added call to Flush to TFilter.Done;
                UseBuf and OwnMem to TRAMStream.
                TTextFilter fixed so that mixed access methods work.
          1.3 - Added TDupFilter, TSequential, CRCs and Checksums
          1.4 - Recoded several of the TRAMStream methods in assembler for
                more speed; fixed numerous TTextFilter bugs and added
                TTextFilter.AssignStream and TextDemo.pas; fixed
                TXMSStream.Seek bug.  Changed xms_Memavail and xms_Maxavail
                to report in bytes, and added ems_Memavail and ems_Maxavail
                (based on code sent to me by Eyal Doron) and disk_Memavail
                and disk_Maxavail. Changed TXMSStream.Init to match
                TEMSStream.Init. Added TConcatFilter, TLimitFilter,
                TLoopFilter, TReverseFilter and TWorkStream.  Added OwnsBase
                field to TFilter.  Did some testing to assure that the unit
                works in BP 7 protected mode.  Thanks to Max Maschein, Eyal
                Doron, and others for bug fix help.
          1.5 - The first public release of the 1.4 enhancements.
          1.6 - fixed some bugs when Getmem returns nil
                fixed bug in ReverseBytes
                fixed bug in termination of TLZWstream
                added workaround for TEMSStream bug, FastCopy }

{ From the original CRC.PAS: }

{ This unit provides three speed-optimized functions to compute (or continue
  computation of) a Cyclic Redundency Check (CRC).  These routines are
  contributed to the public domain (with the limitations noted by the
  original authors in the TASM sources).

  Each function takes three parameters:

  InitCRC - The initial CRC value.  This may be the recommended initialization
  value if this is the first or only block to be checked, or this may be
  a previously computed CRC value if this is a continuation.

  InBuf - An untyped parameter specifying the beginning of the memory area
  to be checked.

  InLen - A word indicating the length of the memory area to be checked.  If
  InLen is zero, the function returns the value of InitCRC.

  The function result is the updated CRC.  The input buffer is scanned under
  the limitations of the 8086 segmented architecture, so the result will be
  in error if InLen > 64k - Offset(InBuf).

  These conversions were done on 10-29-89 by:

{ I believe this is the CRC used by the XModem protocol.  The transmitting
  end should initialize with zero, UpdateCRC16 for the block, Continue the
  UpdateCRC16 for two nulls, and append the result (hi order byte first) to
  the transmitted block.  The receiver should initialize with zero and
  UpdateCRC16 for the received block including the two byte CRC.  The
  result will be zero (why?) if there were no transmission errors.  (I have
  not tested this function with an actual XModem implementation, though I
  did verify the behavior just described.  See TESTCRC.PAS.) }
